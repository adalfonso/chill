- transcoding setting, wifi vs cell data
- alpha band on side for quick scrolling
- reorder playlist by drag mobile/desktop
- investigate: certain images fail to load
- investigate: certain tracks have capitalized spelling or artist name
- optimize album art - don't store per track, group by album
- refresh tokens
- default artist image should be most recent album art
- make media library hide so we can go back to it and resume browsing instead of reload
- when changing stream quality, chrome plays a cached version
- rescanning creates new ids for all media and invalidates a playlist
- what happens when album, artist, etc are missing from files? what happens to urls based on them?
- 1000 degress all listed as "piste"
- dont make node serve static assets, make nginx do it
- consider a monorepo structure
- dragging scrubber while casting is choppy - maybe debounce?
- shuffling large playlist downloads all images
- genre (math rock) artists not CI sorted
- make loading boolean a global affair
- sometimes while casting the UI loses track of the audio progress. this happens after switching tracks quickly, potentially more propne on mobile
- disconnecting from cast and continuing playback plays wrong track (probably issue with syncing crossover)
- doing "play next", letting track finish, "play next"ing something else eventually causes queuing errors and chromecast doesnt play
- queueing a lot of tracks on chromecast will fail and then the natural progression from one track to a next gets out of sync
