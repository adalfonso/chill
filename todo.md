- transcoding setting, wifi vs cell data
- alpha band on side for quick scrolling
- reorder playlist by drag mobile/desktop
- investigate: certain images fail to load
- investigate: certain tracks have capitalized spelling or artist name
- optimize album art - don't store per track, group by album
- refresh tokens
- default artist image should be most recent album art
- make media library hide so we can go back to it and resume browsing instead of reload
- when changing stream quality, chrome plays a cached version
- rescanning creates new ids for all media and invalidates a playlist
- what happens when album, artist, etc are missing from files? what happens to urls based on them?
- 1000 degress all listed as "piste"
- dont make node serve static assets, make nginx do it
